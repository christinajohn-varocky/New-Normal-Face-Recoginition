# Introduction
Facial recognition involves using computing to identify human faces in images or videos, and then measuring specific facial characteristics. This can include the distance between eyes, and the relative positions of the nose, chin and mouth.

This information is combined to create a facial signature, or profile. When used for individual recognition this process of facial “verification” is relatively simple.

However, when facial recognition is used to identify faces in a crowd, it requires a significant database of profiles against which to compare the main image.

These profiles can be legally collected by enrolling large numbers of users into systems. But they’re sometimes collected through covert means.
One consequence of this is that facial recognition systems in place for security and crime prevention may no longer be able to fulfil their purpose.


# Problem Statement
To implement student attendance system based on face recognition with mask and without mask of webcam’s images.
Description: 
Face recognition is a biometric system used for human identification and is widely used .
Now face mask is an inevitable thing in our lifestyle to ensure our safety. Hence we came up with an idea of face recognition with mask and not compromising safety to slightest. 

# Story in short
We used SSD for image detection and face recognition using the FaceNet then we classified the images according to each student using SVM classifier.
The classified images are then saved to an excel sheet for day. This will bring an alternative for school attendence book.
